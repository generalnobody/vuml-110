# K-Means Clustering Algorithm
An implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm written for a project for the Machine Learning course at the Vrije University of Amsterdam.

This project contains the Jupyter Notebook with the Python code used to get the results mentioned in the submitted report, together with the datasets used for the tests on real data.

The libraries required to run the code are NumPy, SciKit Learn, Pandas and Matplotlib.

This repository is a newly created repository for sharing the written code. Therefore, there is no meaningful history in the repository.
